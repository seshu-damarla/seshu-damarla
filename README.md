Bio

👨🏻‍💻 I am a postdoctoral fellow working in Chemical and Materials Engineering at University of Alberta, Canada. I am working on the design, development and deployment of soft sensors (virtual sensors or inferential models) for chemical process industries. I devise the soft sensors using statistical and machine learning algorithms. In addition, I also conduct research on the detection of control valve faults, and the design of classifiers for classification of beverage/water samples.

👯 I am interested in collaborating projects based on machine learning algorithms.

🎓 I received PhD and master of technology (MTech) in chemical engineering from NIT Rourkela, India. During my PhD, I developed orthogonal functions based numerical methods for the simulation, identification and control of integer/non-integer order processes. The following links contain books that I co-authored. All of the work I did in PhD and MTech are provided in the books.
